# Symptom Checker Bot

## Introduction

This is a **console-based Python project** powered by **OpenAI**.
The bot takes user-described symptoms and:

* Suggests probable **minor/common conditions**.
* Recommends the **type of doctor** to consult.
* Suggests mild **OTC remedies** (rest, fluids, paracetamol, etc.).
* **Flags emergencies** (like chest pain, loss of consciousness) and instructs immediate care.
* Refuses non-health queries.

**Important**: This is a **demo/educational tool only**. It does **not** replace professional medical advice.

## Closing Statements

This project is a safe, minimal, and practical demo of how **AI can assist in healthcare triage** while respecting boundaries.  
It’s designed to **educate, not diagnose** - encouraging users to always seek professional medical care when in doubt.

Try it, extend it, and always keep the **ethics of AI in healthcare** in mind.
